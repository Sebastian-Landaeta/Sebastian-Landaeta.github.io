## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

< Overall the goal of the code was simple to understand however understanding the 
prossess of the given functions took longer than expected as well as fully understanding how to incorporate pointer arrays into the mix, which I had to do some 
practice on other codes to fully understand how they work and how to manipulate them. 
Running Valgrind was also simple, I only had 3 errors which were a simple memory leak and an invalid write which where simple to fix. >
