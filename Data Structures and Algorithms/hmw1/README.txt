## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

< Overall the Code was easy. I only ran into basic syntax problems that required me to revew C++ syntax in order to fix them. In addition I ad to research Vecor attributes as well as its related commands to remuve, add, and move values to a specific index which did not present much of a chalenge other than the actual research and implementation of it. Other than these two things I didnt really have much of a problem with major errors which enebled me to create the code with ease. >
