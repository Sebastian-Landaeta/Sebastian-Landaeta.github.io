## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

< Creating a search engine using recursive code with maps was an interesting experience. I had to understand the problem well and choose the right data structures to organize the information effectively. Using recursion helped me explore web pages or directories to extract relevant details for indexing.
During development, I focused on balancing functionality and efficiency. Recursive algorithms are powerful but can cause issues like stack overflow or high memory usage. So, I worked on optimizing the algorithms and handling errors properly.
Overall, building the search engine was challenging but rewarding. It required a mix of problem-solving skills and understanding user needs. Despite the complexities, I enjoyed the process and look forward to making the search engine even better in the future. Assuming my data wont get deleted for no reason wile backing up my memory (:>
