MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:
(The B+ tree is technically not a B+ tree since it only has one leaf however I could not get how to devide it to multiple leafs that contained the valid products and be able to display them ALL. whenever I set a limit to products per leafs I could get all products to be sorted however I could not print all of them (was only able to print how ever many there was on the first leaf and not all the valid leafs)


## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

< making this program was not easy, specially as I didnt understand how to actually make a B+ tree and still dont 100% think I do. As mentioned earlyer the B+ tree is technically not a B+ tree since it only has one leaf however I could not get how to devide it to multiple leafs that contained the valid products and be able to display them ALL. whenever I set a limit to products per leafs I could get all products to be sorted however I could not print all of them (was only able to print how ever many there was on the first leaf and not all the valid leafs). However I do think I did manege to satisfy the assignment>
