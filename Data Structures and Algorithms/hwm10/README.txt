< The program was relativly simple to understand. There were a few hickups along the way do to syntax of the inputs, strings, data changing and manipulating however I maneged with the major ones. Overall it was a straightforward prosses with the queue tho I did no use it much do to the structure of my code and how I could not find how to implement it more frequently in it, tho it is used at least once >
