## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

< The code was not bad to understand what I needed to do however getting the class constructer was rather chalenging. At
first I utilized the code that was introduced to us in lab 2 which allowed us to get each data line split by a space outomatically, 
however I could not get it to work properly with the class constructur that I had build. After I extencively modified both my costructer 
and the file reader I arrived at a dead end in which I realized it was a waste of time to keep attempting something that I could not get to work. 
Thus after cunsulting with different people I arrived at the decition to just utilized the same code I used for homework 1 and read the full line
and send it to a class constructer that had the file reader from my last homework and separated the data line by the space. ofcorse this method was a ortodox, 
however it solved the only major issue that I had. 
Other than that major inconvinence the code was relativley streight forward, it was a matter of data manipulation and parameters and the result was done.>
